# Vehicle-Simulator

## Description

This project is a **Vehicle Management CLI Application** built with **TypeScript**. It allows users to create, manage, and interact with different vehicle types, including **Cars, Trucks, and Motorbikes**.

### Motivation

- To create an **interactive command-line interface** that allows users to simulate vehicle actions.
- To provide a practical tool for managing virtual vehicle data in a structured way.

### Why Build This Project?

- To give users a **hands-on way** to interact with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in a CLI environment.
- To practice working with **TypeScript classes, interfaces, and inheritance**.


### Problems Solved

- Provides an interactive way to **simulate vehicle behavior**.
- Helps reinforce understanding of **Typescript** in a real-world application

### What I Learned

- Implementing **OOP concepts** in TypeScript using classes and interfaces.
- Handling user input and interactions using **Inquirer.js**.
- Managing **data persistence** within a session using JavaScript arrays.
- Patience while working through debugging of Typescript & GitHub
